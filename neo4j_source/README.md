# Neo4j-Source
<h2>New Docker Image</h2>
<p>The writter has described how to build a neo4j cluster in another <a href="https://github.com/yhswjtuILMARE/kubernetes-DB
/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>. The writter does not prepare to note it again. I want to note more details about the new 
image.</p>
<p>As the writter describing in another README.md, the neo4j cluster need at least eight environment variables to build a cluster.</p>
